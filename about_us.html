				<h3>About Us</h3>
				<p>At Dodge's Better Beef, we are committed to producing the highest quality beef and leather products for our loyal customers. Since our founding in 1868, our family-operated business has built a legacy of trust, quality, and excellence in every product we offer. Over the years, Dodge's Better Beef has remained a symbol of tradition and craftsmanship, with every generation dedicated to carrying forward our family's values.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Now in our sixth generation of farming, we are proud to have expanded our reach across New England. Our newly established stores in Ashland and Columbia have allowed us to bring our premium beef and leather products to a growing community of customers. This expansion reflects our desire to serve more families with the same honesty, integrity, and quality that have defined our name for over 150 years.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Our approach to farming is rooted in faith, fairness, and a deep respect for our cattle and the land they graze on. We believe in sustainable, humane farming practices, which is why our cattle are grass-fed and grass-finished, ensuring both their health and the superior taste of our beef. By maintaining ethical farming methods, we are able to provide products that are better for our customers, our animals, and the environment.</p>
				<br>
				<p>When you choose Dodge's Better Beef, you are supporting a business that values quality, tradition, and community. Our legacy continues to grow, and we invite you to be a part of it. From our family farm to your family table, we are honored to serve you the best beef and leather products New England has to offer.</p>
				<br>
				<h3>Our Values</h3>
				<p>Family is at the heart of Dodge's Better Beef. Since 1868, our family has worked hand-in-hand to provide the highest quality beef and leather products to our customers. Our multi-generational approach ensures that the knowledge, skills, and love for farming are passed down, preserving our proud heritage. We view every customer interaction as an extension of this family tradition, treating you with the same respect and care we give to our own.</p>
				<br>
				<p>We believe that quality should never be compromised. From the tenderness of our ribeye steaks to the durability of our hand-crafted leather belts, every product we create reflects our pursuit of excellence. By adhering to strict quality standards, we ensure that each cut of beef and every leather good meets the high expectations of our customers.</p>
				<br>
				<p>Fairness extends to our employees, customers, and partners. We believe in treating others with dignity, from the way we support our team members to the way we price our products. Fairness also means maintaining transparency in our business practices. Our customers deserve to know where their food comes from and how it was raised, which is why we uphold an open, honest relationship with our community. Our values are more than words on a page—they are lived out every day on our farm, in our stores, and at every point of contact with our customers. At Dodge's Better Beef, we don’t just raise cattle; we raise the standard for what a family-operated, faith-driven business should be. We invite you to experience the difference that strong values make.</p>
