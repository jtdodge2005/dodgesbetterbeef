				<h3>Return Policy</h3>
				<p>We stand behind the quality of our products and are committed to customer satisfaction. If you are not satisfied with your purchase, we offer a simple and fair return process. For beef products, returns are only accepted if there is an issue with the quality or condition of the product upon arrival. If you encounter any issues, please contact our customer support team within 48 hours of delivery, and we will work with you to resolve the matter, which may include issuing a replacement or refund.</p>
				<br>
				<p>For leather products, returns are accepted within 30 days of purchase, provided the items are unused, unworn, and in like-new condition. Customers are responsible for return shipping costs unless the item is defective or incorrect. To initiate a return, please contact our support team, and we will guide you through the process. Refunds are processed within 7 business days after the return is received and inspected. We value your trust and will do everything we can to ensure your satisfaction.</p>
				<br>
				<h3>Shipping Policy</h3>
				<p>At Dodge's Better Beef, we strive to provide a seamless and efficient shipping experience for our customers. All orders are processed within 3 business days and shipped directly from our farm to your doorstep. We ship our products ourselves to ensure that your products arrive fresh, secure, and on time. Shipping times may vary based on location, but most orders within New England are delivered within 5 business days.</p>
				<br>
				<p>For beef products, we use insulated, refrigerated packaging to maintain freshness throughout the journey without freezing. Our leather goods are carefully packaged to protect against damage during transit. Customers will receive a tracking number via email as soon as their order ships, allowing them to monitor its progress in real-time. If there are any delays or issues with shipping, our customer service team is ready to assist. Shipping costs are calculated at checkout and may vary based on weight, location, and delivery speed.</p>
				<br>
				<h3>Financing Policy</h3>
				<p>Dodge's Better Beef understands that quality products are an investment, which is why we offer flexible financing options for larger purchases, annual orders, or ordering in bulk. For qualifying orders of $1000 or more, customers can choose to split their payments into smaller, manageable installments through our partnership with a third-party financing provider. This option is available at checkout and requires a quick approval process with minimal impact on your credit score.</p>
